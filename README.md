# semantic-book-keeping
Simple Book Keeping (Accounting) using normal human semantics.

## idea
book Keeping should be as easier as we write down to remember any financial matters.

## approach
simple human-like syntax to depict daily transactions.

## example
@myself paid @my_wife 10000 for some reasons (tokens : myself, paid, wife, 10000, some-reasons)
@myself received from @some_friend Rs 10000 for short term (tokens: myself, received, some_friend, 10000, short term)
